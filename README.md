# PyCon Organizers Manual

###Introduction

The PyCon Organizers Manual, an effort started by the 2016 - 2017 Python Software Foundation Board of Directors, is an evolving document containing information about how to get started organizing a PyCon or another Python conference.

####Why do we need PyCon Organizers Manual?

Organizing a PyCon is no easy feat. It requires a lot of time and effort. This project aims to continue on the work of previous projects by creating an easy to read, easy to contribute to open source PyCon Manual.

Anyone is welcome to contribute and offer feedback. If you would like to participate, please read the [how you can contribute](https://github.com/lorenanicole/pycon_organizers_manual/tree/master/contributing) chapter to get started.
